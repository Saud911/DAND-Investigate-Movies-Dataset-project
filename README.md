This project was the second project of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.
## Overview
On this project I investigated the TMDB movies data which contains a lot of information relevent to the movies  by addressing some analtiycal questions and brought up our analysis based on the results.

The questions were : 
##### Q1) What are the Top 5 Movies made highest Profits?
